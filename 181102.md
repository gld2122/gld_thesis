# PROGRESS REPORT FOR FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2ND, 2018

You'll find many bizarre anecdotes on the internet in the "weird news" sections
of a person's name "misbehaving" vis-à-vis its digital representation in a
computerized database. So far I have found detailed information for the
following case studies:

1. California's ban on diacritical marks in names, which I discussed.
2. A Hawaiian woman whose 35-letter surname drove her on a years-long
   crusade to have her full name included on her drivers' license
3. A Chinese woman whose name includes the uncommon character '𩧢' which is not
   recognized by the Chinese government's database systems

I plan to dredge the internet for more examples like this.

The stories are what have prompted my research but clearly they do not justify
it. The reason such situations matter is because names matter deeply on both a
personal and cultural level; it forms a part of our identiy, or better, an
expression of our identity. The first part of the paper will actually be about
the different functions that a name can play. So far I have found a two-way
distinction between reference and symbol.

A name has a reference function when it selects some individual in the world. To
select John, you find the (relatively) unique person in the world named John;
John stands for a larger complex of physical and personality traits, the full
person.
