"You see, to some people in the world, your name is everything. If I say my name
to an elder Hawaiian (kupuna), they know everything about my husband's family
going back many generations... just from the name. When the name is sliced up,
changed or altered it distorts the intention and meaning that the name
represents. Unfortunately, many people have been shamed into hiding their real
names because they don't fit in with the dominant culture's lack of respect for
the name.

P.S. If bills or traffic citations are not correctly addressed, my husband
refuses to pay and is under no obligation legally to pay."
