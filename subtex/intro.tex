\section{Introduction}

In complex industrial societies, governments and institutions wield great
administrative power over the lives of ordinary people. In this paper, we will
explore restrictions that parents face in the naming of children. The naming
process is cross-culturally considered the prerogative of the child's parents or
close relatives (Alford). Yet the right is not absolute in modern contexts. Some
restrictions are issued by the government. As \textcite{scott02} has found,
administrators' desire for "synoptic legibility" is a driving force in changing
the form of personal names in industrialised societies, eg. through the
standardisation of surnames.  In the digital world, we can extend this argument
to institutions like Facebook and Twitter, whose social networks prescribe forms
that names on the site must fit \parencite{what-names-fb}.

In many cases, the restrictions are issued to promote administrative convenience
or compatibility with digital systems, which require that names adhere to a
particular form. In other cases, however, the government takes a more active
role in name administration, such as by promulgating an approved names list
(Iceland) or by subjecting them to a process of administrative overrule
(Qu√©bec), thereby promoting a social (or ethnocentric) policy agenda.

On a personal level, how are people affected when their name doesn't "play nice"
with the system? We will look at several cases of people whose names either
could not be properly represented in a digital format or did not accord with the
government's naming policies. How do the persons feel about changing their names
for the convenience of administration? How flexible or willing are governments
or companies to rectify the situation? These are issues at the crux of the
modern discourse on how to balance administrative efficiency with respect for
human dignity; in short, how to stave off alienation in a modern world.

First, we'll review the worldwide diversity of naming customs and consider what
sociological functions are played by a name's contents. Then we will examine the
restrictions on personal naming. Then we will examine cases in which people's
names do not "play nice" with a computer system, or are rejected by an
administrator. These stories typically come from the "bizarre news" section of a
newspaper, but they prompt more serious questions, such as how concentrated
power is reshaping personal and cultural identities. These cases typify either a
need for administrative convenience, or an social naming policy. In some cases
we find a combination of the two rationales. We will consider each of the
following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item How does institutional power limit the choice of personal names?
\item How can computers impact personal and cultural identities?
\item How can we protect the social content of names in developing countries
and/or among minority-language speakers?
\end{itemize}
