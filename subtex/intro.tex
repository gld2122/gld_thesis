You see, to some people in the world, your name is everything. If I say my name
to an elder Hawaiian (kupuna), they know everything about my husband's family
going back many generations...just from the name.

\subsection{Names}

Article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child enshrines a person's
inalienable right to a name: "The child shall be registered immediately after
birth and shall have the right from birth to a name." \parencite{crc} A name is
the fundamental token which identifies a person \textit{qua} individual; it
transmits information about its bearer, including cultural idenitification,
genealogical history, religious beliefs, and linguistic origins.

At the same time, a name cannot remain the sole province of its owner; it must
facilitate interaction with the wider world as a means of address. A name is
\textit{a priori} useless if others people in the environs cannot pronounce it,
write it, or remember it. Names thus serve functions on a spectrum ranging from
the expressive to the utilitarian.
