\subsection{Zhao C}

In 2006, a Chinese man with the lifelong name of Zhao C (èµµC) found that the
Public Security Bureau would no longer grant him an ID card including a Latin

father's evidence rested on the fact that Latin characters are already
well-integrated in to Chinese life; for example, the name of CCTV, China's
national broadcasting channel, and the Pinyin system, which is the PRC-endorsed
transcription system for Mandarin. The case was resolved when Zhao volunatarily
agreed to change his name and avoid further headache
