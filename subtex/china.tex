\section{China}

\subsection{Introduction}

Given the People's Republic of China's (PRC) diverse population and linguistic
landscape, language is an important vehicle for promoting the government's
cultural policy. The PRC has distinguished mainland Chinese from the language of
Taiwan via the simplification of Chinese script in the 1950s, reducing both the
number and complexity of characters. Moreover, mainland Chinese is distinctive
for the standardised use of Pīnyīn romanisation since 1958, vis-à-vis Taiwan,
where competing systems like Wade-Giles continue to to coëxist with Pīnyīn.
Government intervention favouring a nationwide Mandarin standard (Pǔtōnghuà:
"common language") puts both provincial Chinese dialects (Cantonese,
Shanghainese) and non-Chinese languages (Tibetan, Uyghur) at risk. Pǔtōnghuà is
thus "enregistered" as an "accentless" dialect \parencite{dong10}, while
regional dialects are in danger as upwardly-mobile youth move to cities and
adopt the standard variety. In 2003, Xing found that there were 22 minority
languages with fewer than 10,000 speakers.

\subsection{Second-Generation ID Cards}

China's Public Security Bureau (PSB) instituted a digital system around 2004 to
issue and track personal identification cards. The new IDs have an embedded
microchip with personal and security information and were intended to improve
the Bureau's population statistics and anti-forgery protection
\parencite{ciicn04}.

Digital management of ID cards has caused administrative hassle for many Chinese
citizens with uncommon names. Government computers (as of 2009) can only
accommodate 32,252 Chinese characters; if someone's name includes a character
outside the list, they are asked to change it \parencite{lafraniere09}.

\subsection{Mǎ Chěng}

A woman named Mǎ Chěng ({\zafont 马}{\zbfont 𩧢}) was one victim of this policy,
as reported by \textcite{lafraniere09} for \textit{The New York Times}. Mǎ's
grandfather scoured a classical Chinese dictionary for a distinctive name and
chose an obscure character, which complemented the family name, mǎ ({\zafont
马}) "horse": chěng ({\zbfont 𩧢}) "gallop" (the traditional form of {\zafont
马} ({\zafont 馬}) written three times). Mǎ's previous ID card included a
handwritten {\zbfont 𩧢}, but the digital system would not allow this; thus the
Bureau recommended she change her name for compatibility purposes.

The open-ended nature of Chinese script makes it possible to find legitimate
characters that are barely comprehensible to the average reader, due to their
being uncommon or archaic. Most hànzì consist of smaller radicals, which are
themselves hànzì or derivatives thereof. Thus the writing system is composite
and open to internal manipulation, unlike alphabetic systems. This fact can be
viewed positively or negatively. As Chinese uses comparatively few surnames, one
can worry that name trends will carry parents away into the Classical Chinese
abyss, away from the realm of mutual comprehension.

A linguistics professor interviewed for the \textcite{lafraniere09} article
notes: "The computer cannot even recognize [some names] and people cannot read
them. This has become an obstacle in communication." On the other, Mǎ lived
satisfactorily with the name for twenty-six years. Whenever necessary, she
explained her name to people. Agencies were often willing to accommodate the
rare character, by handwriting it, writing in pīnyīn, searching the Unicode
table, or even building the character themselves with software
\parencite{martinsen08}. In the process, the people whom Mǎ encountered would learn
more about their own writing system and its history. This give-and-take is lost
when rigid administrative rules are instituted.

The government's treatment of Ma's name suggests an ambiguous relationship with
the Classical Chinese legacy. On one hand, promotion of Pǔtōnghuà is presented
in terms of the Confucian ideal of hé ({\zafont 和}) "harmony", under former
President Hú Jǐntāo's Harmonious Society programme \parencite{wang16}. Yet the
CPC's ongoing efforts to simplify and control the Chinese script favours
progress over the veneration of history.

\subsection{Zhao C}

Zháo C ({\zafont 赵}C) faced a similar situation due to an English letter
appearing in his name. The Bureau ruled that only Chinese characters may appear
in names and refused to issue a second-generation card to Zháo. Since Zháo's
father is a lawyer, they appealed the decision, arguing that 'C' appears in
Pīnyīn romanisations and in tradenames of Chinese institutions like CCTV, the
Chinese national broadcasting service. Apparently the judge was unconvinced, as
Zháo volunatarily agreed to change his name, asking the public for suggestions.
\parencite{martinsen09}

Although the letter 'C' is easily represented on Chinese computers the
restriction on English letters intends to protect the Chinese linguistic
framework from Western encroachment. In this way, China's approach is more
typical of small countries protecting their national language, as we see in the
case of Iceland and Lithuania. As Zháo pointed out, infiltration of English into
Chinese society (CCTV, for instance) has occurred, despite the simultaneous
spread of Pǔtōnghuà as a hegemonic dialect in China. China's (and Lithuania's)
specific ban on foreign influence in names, contrasted with the relative
lenience on matters like signs and business names ("taxi", "TV") suggests that
names are considered very close to "the language itself".

\subsection{Analysis}

In both Lithuania and China, personal names are subject to more scrutiny than
the language at large. Borrowed words like "taxi" or "TV" are accepted when used
in a commercial context, but unacceptable when used in a name. Speakers think of
names as exemplifying the social content and meaning of a language variety, and
thus in need of protection against foreign influence. Yet in China, perhaps
uniquely, the name régime acts against threats from both the past (the
conservative veneration of Classical Chinese) and the future (the globalisation
of English), seeking a balance between the two approaches.
