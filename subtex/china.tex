\subsection{The Case of Zhao C}

[how did it impact life]

A man who had gone by the name of Zhao C his whole life found that the Public
Security Bureau would no longer grant him an ID card that includes a Latin
character. Luckily Mr. Zhao's father was a lawyer, and brought suit. The
father's evidence rested on the fact that Latin characters are already
well-integrated in to Chinese life; for example, the name of CCTV, China's
national broadcasting channel, and the Pinyin system, which is the PRC-endorsed
transcription system for Mandarin. The case was resolved when Zhao agreed to
voluntarily change his name, presumably to avoid further administrative headache
for the rest of his life.
