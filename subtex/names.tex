\section{Functions of Names}

The canonical job of a name is reference: a linguistic token selecting an individual for discussion or address. This role is complemented by a second: conveyance of cultural information about the bearer. In some cases, the two functions are opposed to one another, and a balance must be struck between legibility and free expression.

Name-giving is a cultural universal; ethnographers have found no society past or present that does not give names to individuals \parencite{alford87}. Naming is deeply rooted as a rite of human identity. We know from historians and ethnographers that preïndustrial naming differs greatly from industrialised practices. The Nuers of Sudan take two given names (maternal and paternal), a ceremonial clan name, and an ox name of a favourite domestic animal \parencite{wardhaugh92}. Likewise, nicknames are liberally bestowed based on traits and accomplishments (Giriama). The idea of \textit{fixing} the name is not a given; names can vary by context and across time and space.

Enter bureaucratisation and industrialisation, and we see concomitantly the canonicalisation of name. A mobile population or impersonal state presence requires accurate and speedy identification of individuals. Hence \textcite{scott02} observe that patrilineal surnames tend to arise wherever centralisation is occurring: Qin China, Norman England, Atatürkian Turkey. As they suggest, patrilineal surnames are perfectly suited to state functions requiring clear identification of individuals: taxation, conscription, and justice \parencite[18]{scott02}. In fact, the administrative dream is not a name at all, but a unique serial number assigned to every person.

Canonicalisation's raison d'être is producing a particular brand of knowledge, which is legible, objective, and public. So the name becomes a tracker to follow the person's movements, marriages, kinship, and careers, the emphasis being placed on the individual's relation to society rather than the individual themselves.

\subsubsection{Symbolic Functions}

\begin{aquote}{Janice "Lokelani" Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele

	You see, to some people in the world, your name is everything. If I say my
	name to an elder Hawaiian (kupuna), they know everything about my husband's
	family going back many generations…just from the name.
\end{aquote}

The symbolic function of a name is that in which the name's content itself
conveys a complex of information, be it genealogical, cultural, linguistic,
religious, etc. This is the function that digital records threaten to eliminate,
as it is fluid and ephemeral, whereas computers require complete unambiguity.

We can subdivide a name's symbolic functions into two aspects that must be
balanced; they sit on a spectrum between what \textcite{finch08} calls
individualizing functions and connecting functions.

Individualizing functions are those aspects of a name which make a statement on
the individual themselves. The clearest manifestation of this is the choice of a
child's forename; indeed this makes more of a statement on the parent than the
child itself. "In selecting a name (especially for a first-born child) parents
are not only determining the personhood of their child but are also taking a key
step in defining their own new identity as parents." \parencite[718]{finch08}
Hence a parent can name their child something "beautiful" like "Isabella" or
something "strong" like "Samson".

\begin{aquote}{Albus Dumbledore}
"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a
name increases fear of the thing itself." \parencite{rowling97}
\end{aquote}

Connecting functions are facets that locate the individual within larger milieu.
this takes the form of surnames, which in Anglophone societies identify the
paternal family unit to which the individual belongs. "The construction of a
name, and its uses through a lifetime, also can embody a sense of connectedness
with family - with the parents who gave the name, and with others in a domestic
arrangement or a kin network with whom all or part of the name is shared."
\parencite[711]{finch08} We can find more subtle connecting functions, however.
Choosing a first name after an older ancestor connects you to a more specific
family relationship. And even the linguistic or religious connotations carried
within the first or last name can connect a person to or set them apart from the
dominant society in which they live.
