American law generally holds the naming of children to be the right and
responsibility of parents, without shutting the door on regulating edge cases,
like "Ghoul Nipple", "Legend Belch",
"Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116", and "" [Larson11]. In many
American states, however, this right is abridged with reference to diacritical
marks above letters, hardly an edge case in many languages around the world.
[Larson11] investigates this in his study of American naming law, finding states
with such rules to include California, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Kansas:

## California

Guidelines provided by the California Office of Vital Records instruct county
clerks that baby names may contain only "the 26 alphabetical characters of the
English language with appropriate punctuation if necessary" and that “no
pictographs, ideograms, diacritical marks" (including “é,” “ñ,” and “ç”) are
allowed" [Larson11]. The handbook cites Proposition 63, in which voters declared
English the official language of California, as legal justification; (although
Larson points out that the names of two California state parks (Año Nuevo State
Park and Montaña de Oro State Park) manage to contain such characters.

### 2014-AB-2528

A 2014 bill in the California State Assembly sponsored by Nancy Skinner
(AB-2528) attempted to rectify the state's processing of birth certificates and
driver's licenses to allow the inclusion of diacritical marks in names. The bill
would have "required the State Registrar to ensure that diacritical marks on
English letters are properly recorded on birth certificates, death certificates,
certificates of fetal death, and marriage licenses, including, but not limited
to, accents, tildes, graves, umlauts, and cedillas" [AB-2528]. This bill stalled
in the Appropriations Committee when the Departments of Public Health and Motor
Vehicles, as well as the California Secretary of State's office, predicted
multi-million dollar price tags relating to IT upgrades, noting that the DMV's
software could not "even accept lower-case letters". For this same reason the
bill was opposed by the County Recorder's Association of California.

### 2017-AB-82

In 2017 AM Jose Medina revived the issue with AB-82, which managed to pass both
houses of the legislature before being vetoed by Governor Jerry Brown. Unlike
the 2014 bill, this edition did not affect the issuance of driver's licenses.
Passing through many more stages of the legislative process, the committee
hearings identified more concrete figures for the cost of IT upgrades to
government agencies:

* $230,000 for IT upgrades at Department of Public Health
* $2 million per year for Department of Public Health to amend existing records
* Loss of revenue of $450,000 per year to Department of Public Health since they
  would not be able to electronically transmit names to SSA (at $3 per name)
  containing diacritics
* Up to $12 million for local governments to upgrade their systems
* $1–3 million in upgrades to Department of Health Care Services
* "Unknown" administrative costs to Department of Social Services

The sticking point for Governor Brown related to concerns with
compatibility with federal recordkeeping systems, which do not accept
diacritics. He expressed this in his veto message:

"Mandating the use of diacritical marks on certain state and local vital records
without a corresponding requirement for all state and federal government records
is a difficult and expensive proposition. This bill would create inconsistencies
in vital records and require significant state funds to replace or modify
existing registration systems."

Interestingly, there is no mention in the documents of the possibility of
"converting" the name record, when necessary, into a non-diacritical form
compatible with other systems; nevertheless, it seems clear from the committee
hearings that the costs of implementation are nontrivial.

## Massachusetts

In Massachusetts, the “characters have to be on the standard american [sic]
keyboard. So dashes and apostrophes are fine, but not accent marks and the
such”. [Larson11]

## New Hampshire

"All special characters other than an apostrophe or dash" are prohibited.
[Larson11]

## Kansas

Restrictions are similar to those in Massachusetts. [Larson11]
