American law generally holds the naming of a child to be the right and
responsibility of the parents. In many American states, however, this right is
abridged with reference to diacritical marks, a common feature in many languages
around the world. [Larson11] investigates this in his study of American naming
law, finding states with such rules to include California, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, and Kansas:

## California

A handbook provided by the California Office of Vital Records instructs county
clerks that baby names may contain only "the 26 alphabetical characters of the
English language with appropriate punctuation if necessary" and that “no
pictographs, ideograms, diacritical marks” (including “é,” “ñ,” and “ç”) are
allowed" [Larson11]. It is notable that two California state parks indeed
include two such characters (Año Nuevo State Park and Montaña de Oro State
Park).

### 2014-AB-2528

A 2014 bill in the California State Assembly (AB-2528) attempted to rectify the
situation with regards to birth certificates and licenses issued by the state
DMV, but this bill stalled in the Appropriations Committee when high price tags
relating to IT upgrades were attached.

### 2017-AB-82

The issue was resurrected in 2017 with the bill AB-82 sponsored by Jose Medina,
which actually passed both houses of the legislature but was vetoed by Governor
Brown, again because of the high price tag.

## Massachusetts

In Massachusetts, the “characters have to be on the standard american [sic]
keyboard. So dashes and apostrophes are fine, but not accent marks and the
such”. [Larson11]

## New Hampshire

"All special characters other than an apostrophe or dash" are prohibited.
[Larson11]

## Kansas

Restrictions are similar to those in Massachusetts. [Larson11]
