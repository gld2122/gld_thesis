Anglo-American law generally holds the naming of a child to be the right and
responsibility of the parents. In many American states, however, this right is
abridged with regard to the inclusion of diacritical marks, which laws
[Larson11] investigated in his article. permitted by the Office of Vital
Statistics to add a diacritical mark (eg María) to the name of a child born in
the state. Such states include California, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and
Kansas.

## California

A handbook provided by the California Office of Vital Records instructs county
clerks that baby names may contain only "the 26 alphabetical characters of the
English language with appropriate punctuation if necessary" and that “no
pictographs, ideograms, diacritical marks” (including “é,” “ñ,” and “ç”) are
allowed" [Larson11].

## Massachusetts

In Massachusetts, the “characters have to be on the standard american [sic]
keyboard. So dashes and apostrophes are fine, but not accent marks and the
such.” [Larson11]

## New Hampshire

"All special characters other than an apostrophe or dash" are prohibited.
[Larson11]

## Kansas

Restrictions are similar to those in Massachusetts. [Larson11]
