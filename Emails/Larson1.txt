Hello Professor Larson,

I am a student at Columbia University researching on Official English
language laws for my senior thesis in Linguistics. I read your article "Naming
Baby: The Constitutional Dimensions of Parental Naming Rights" and was very
surprised by states' bans on names containing diacritical marks, particularly
California with its huge Hispanophone population. Much of the article's
information on this topic came from your emails with state officials, according
to the citations.

I would like to understand how these bans on diacritical marks came about. Is it
through statutory provisions? Is it informal practice of local administrators
without clear guidance? Were there legitimate issues in the past leading to the
adoption of these policies? I can find no information on the topic in the state
codes so was hoping you could point me on the right track.

Sincerely,

Gabe DeFreitas
