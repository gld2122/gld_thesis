# LEGAL RESTRICTIONS ON NAMING: ADMINISTRATIVE CONVENIENCE AND LINGUISTIC POLITICS

This paper examines naming practices in several countries from a sociolinguistic
perspective. Although naming is universally held to be the prerogative of a
child's parents \parencite{alford87}, most states abridge this right to some
extent. In the case of "bizarre" names like "Adolf Hitler" and "Ghoul Nipple"
\parencite{larson11}, overruling parental choice is a clear-cut measure to
protect child welfare. However, many policies are instituted for more subtle
aims, including bureaucratic efficiency and linguistic policy. We will compare
naming laws in four jurisdictions, namely California, Lithuania, Iceland, and
the People's Republic of China. We observe that the rationale and methods for
restricting names are influenced by the country's official language policies and
status of the languages themselves.
